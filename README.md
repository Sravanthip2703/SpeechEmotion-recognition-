# Speech Emotion Recognition

## Description
The Speech Emotion Recognition project aims to develop a system that can automatically detect emotions from speech signals. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques, the project identifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and neutrality from audio data. The system can be integrated into real-world applications like virtual assistants, customer service bots, and mental health monitoring.

Dataset
Dataset Used: Describe the dataset used for training and testing (e.g., TESS, RAVDESS).
Description: Explain the dataset details, including the number of samples, emotions labeled, and format.
Data Preprocessing: How the data is prepared, including splitting into training and test sets, normalization, and augmentation (if any).
Preprocessing
Audio Preprocessing:
Resampling: Adjusting the sample rate.
Noise Reduction: Removing background noise.
Normalization: Ensuring consistency across samples.
Trimming/Silence Removal: Removing silent parts of the audio.
Feature Extraction
MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients):

Captures the spectral characteristics of speech.
Represents the audio signalâ€™s power spectrum on a mel scale.
Formant Frequencies:

Represents resonance frequencies in speech.
Useful for understanding the shape of the vocal tract and its emotional state.
Pitch and Pitch Contour:

Fundamental frequency variations correlated with emotions.
Useful for distinguishing between emotional states like calmness and anger.
Speech Rate:

Words per minute, indicating emotional arousal.
Higher rates for excitement, lower for sadness.
Energy:

Intensity of the speech signal.
High energy for emotions like anger, low energy for sadness.
Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR):

Measures the rate at which the signal changes its sign.
Indicates the temporal dynamics of the speech signal.
Modeling
Machine Learning Models:
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Used for initial testing and baselines.
Deep Learning Models:
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Suitable for sequential data like speech.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Used for extracting spatial features from spectrograms.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): For capturing temporal dependencies in the audio data.
Evaluation
Metrics Used:
Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
F1-score: Balances precision and recall, especially for imbalanced data.
Evaluation Process:
Cross-validation: To ensure robustness of the model.
Confusion Matrix: To analyze misclassifications.
Results
Model Performance:

Provide information on accuracy, F1-score, and other relevant metrics.
Include confusion matrix and visualizations of the results.
Visualization:

Graphs of training/validation loss and accuracy.
Examples of classified emotions with their probabilities.
